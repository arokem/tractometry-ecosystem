For example, the degree of\nmyelination in the newborn brain is much smaller than in the adult brain. This\nis apparent when examining a newborn infants T1-weighted MRI, where gray matter\nappears _brighter_ than the white matter. As the brain white matter myelinates\nin the first few months of life, this contrast inverts with a point of roughly\nequal brightness around 6 months of age (for a review see\n[Gilmore, 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2018.1)).\n\nTherefore, tractometry of neonates requires methods that are substantially \ndifferent than the methods that are used for adult brains. The principles are \nsimilar, but the details vary. For example, instead of using the MNI152 template \nthat is used in adults, we use an infant-oriented template [Shi et al, 2021](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018746). \n\nFurthermore, the waypoint ROIs that are used in infant data differ in their\nposition from the adult. These waypoint ROIs were first defined and integrated\ninto the Matlab version of AFQ in [Grotheer, 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28326-4), and and validated\nagainst expert-delineated tracts. The infant template and ROIs were\nsubsequently integrated into pyAFQ in [Grotheer, 2023](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2303491120) and the Python\nimplementation was again validated with respect to these expert-delineated\nmanual tracts.\n\nIn this example, an example of babyAFQ is presented with data from one of the \nsubjects whose data was first presented in [Grotheer, 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28326-4).
